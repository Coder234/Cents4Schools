<font face="Arial" color="yellow" size="16px">  About 70 million children around the world are in need of an education. That is about 4 times the population of New York! 70 millon minds that will not be molded. 70 millon minds that will not help build our future. One of the main reasons children do not have access to an education is, money. Many third world countries barely have the money for food or water, let alone educating their children. Another problem many penniless countries face is lack of resources. Pencils, books, teachers, the schools, all ideas that couldnt be farther from a unprivliaged persons mind, and their wallet. 
	
	So what can we do? We can stop complaining about the world, and start improving it!  </font> 
	<h2> <br>Our Solution

        <font face="Arial" color="yellow" size="16px"> Like many life changing things in this world, to provide all these educational services, it requires money. That is why it is our mission to not only provide educational services, but also funraise. To donate money <a href="donate.html">click here.</a> once we recieve funding, our team locates a specific part of the world in need of education, and travels there. Once there, our team provides whichever of our services the location needs. These include: robots, housing, and resources.
